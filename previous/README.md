# Homework

For each assignment given in this repository:

1. Open this repository in GitPod.
2. Create and switch to a new feature branch.
3. Complete the assignment on the feature branch (stage, commit, push)
4. Create an MR for the feature branch back to the main branch on GitLab (default).

In short, your work is ***officially and correctly submitted*** when your work
is in a feature branch that has been pushed to this repository on GitLab
and a merge request has been created back to the same repository.

You may update your feature branch without penalty up-to the end of the
grace period. If you change your feature branch after this deadline but
within 1-week of the initial homework deadly, and you want your updates
graded, ***send your instructor an email and/or a Discord message*** to that
effect. Your update will be graded in accordance with the late policy
as explained in the course syllabus.
